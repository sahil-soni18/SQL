# SQL Practice Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to SQL problems from platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**. The goal of this repository is to document my progress in learning SQL and showcase solutions for a variety of database query challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on the platform and difficulty level of the problems. Here's the directory structure:

```



## Platforms

### HackerRank
- Problems solved on HackerRank are divided into three categories:
  - **Easy**
  - **Medium**
  - **Hard**

### LeetCode
- Problems solved on LeetCode follow the same categorization:
  - **Easy**
  - **Medium**
  - **Hard**


## Problem Format

Each SQL file includes the following:
- Problem name and link
- The SQL query solution

Example format:
```sql
-- Problem: Select All Records
-- Platform: HackerRank
-- URL: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/select-all-records/problem

SELECT * FROM employees;
```



## How to Use This Repository

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the platform and difficulty level to view solutions.



## Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal implementations. Use them to learn and understand SQL concepts. Avoid copying them directly into your own submissions for coding platforms.



## Future Goals

- Practice advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, CTEs, and optimization.
- Solve more problems on additional platforms like **StrataScratch** and **DataLemur**.
- Explore practical SQL projects to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.
